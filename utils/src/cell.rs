//!
//! Persistent memory cell for non-zeroed SRAM.
//!
//! This module provides [`MemCell`], a low-level abstraction for memory regions
//! that survive resets (for example, Backup SRAM).
//!
//! # Safety Model
//!
//! `MemCell<T>` provides raw access to a memory region that is assumed to:
//!
//! - Survive system resets
//! - Not be automatically zero-initialized
//! - Exist for the entire lifetime of the program
//!
//! This type deliberately does **not** participate in Rust's ownership,
//! aliasing, or drop semantics. All safety guarantees must be upheld
//! externally by the caller.
//!
//! In particular:
//!
//! - Initialization state is tracked manually via a magic value
//! - Interior mutability is provided through raw pointers
//! - No attempt is made to synchronize concurrent access
//!
//! Misuse of this type can easily result in undefined behavior.
//!
//! # Note:
//!
//! This abstraction does not provide any memory ordering guarantees beyond
//! volatile access. On systems with caches, DMA, or multiple cores, additional
//! synchronization may be required.
//!
//! This abstraction does not provide atomicity guarantees.
//! Partial writes may be observable if a reset occurs mid-operation.
//!

    ///   linker, or hardware.
