//!
//! Frame-related core abstractions.
//!
//! This module defines the fundamental building blocks used by the
//! framing layer of the protocol. It does not perform I/O or buffering
//! itself, but provides the types and traits required to encode, decode,
//! and validate framed messages.
//!
//! Provided abstractions:
//!
//! - **`Validator`**
//!   Defines checksum algorithms used by the protocol (CRC8 / CRC16).
//!   This allows different protocol variants to reuse the same framing
//!   logic with different validation rules.
//!
//! - **`DjiValidator`**
//!   A concrete `Validator` implementation using DJI-compatible CRC
//!   algorithms.
//!
//! - **`Marshaler`**
//!   Describes how a payload type is serialized into bytes and restored
//!   from raw payload data. Each implementation is bound to a fixed
//!   command ID and is independent from framing details.
//!
//! - **`RawFrame`**
//!   A lightweight view of a decoded frame, exposing the command ID,
//!   sequence number, and a borrowed payload slice without allocation.
//!
